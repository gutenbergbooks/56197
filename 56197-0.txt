AUTHORS’ NOTE


In bringing out this, the second volume of the Cupid’s Almanack, we have
deemed it advisable to devote our principal effort to informing you, Good
Hearticulturists, just what the conditions of the elements will be at the
various seasons. This is of the greatest importance, and the success of
your work depends largely upon the judgment used in selecting the time to
begin.

Enthusiasm is necessary but do not be too impetuous for many a failure
has come from rushing ahead while yet conditions are too cold and many a
Hope Vine has been killed by a late frost.

If you have started your work indoors do not be in too great haste to
set out; young plants need a great deal of warmth and attention and can
stand extremely high temperature, while very little cold is apt to be
fatal.

In Hearticulture so much depends on—whether?

THE WATER-MAN

    When I consider how I spent my days,
      And mind me of the reckless race I ran,
    I am resolved that I will mend my ways,
      And swear henceforth to be a Water-man.

CUPID’S FORECAST

JANUARY

General depression, caused by Brain-storms of December. This is succeeded
by a wave of Good Resolutions, accompanied by a general downpour of Ice
Water. The cold wave may be counted upon to pass quickly, being followed
by brighter days and a Rising Glass.

The Fishes

THE FISHES

    Now forth to fish goes good Saint Valentine,
      And baits his gentle hook with tender wishes,
    Cupid has lent his bow for rod and line.
      Alas! Our time has come—we are the fishes.

CUPID’S FORECAST

FEBRUARY

Generally frigid airs, varied by storms and melting spells, with
changing temperature until the Fourteenth, when a soft wave will sweep
over the country accompanied by sentimental Mail Storms, resulting in a
general rise of temperament and a happier atmosphere. Husbandmen who are
cultivating matrimony will be much troubled through this month by the
squally nights.

The Ram

[Illustration]

THE RAM

    The wind is like to a Rampageous Ram,
      That rushes to and fro and round about.
    I speed my parting hat with futile damn,
      As my umbrella turneth inside out.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

CUPID’S FORECAST

MARCH

Marked coldness, followed by windy sighs, culminating in stormy bluster.
Alternate Frostiness and Melting. A depressing month and one to test the
intensity of the heart gardener. All but the hardiest plants must be
given extreme attention, and many gardeners, to avoid the danger of a
frost, sit up far into the night with their favorite plants during this
month. But at the best it is apt to be chilly and unpleasant going. The
month ends in calm, indifferent weather.

APRIL


[Illustration: _Taurus_]

The Bull

[Illustration]

THE BULL

    Thro’ melting clouds the ever-gaining Sun
      Predicts a rise in Summer’s stock to-day.
    The Bears of Winter now are on the run,
      The Bull of Spring o’er April’s Bourse holds sway.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

CUPID’S FORECAST

APRIL

Less cold but very changeable. Brief intervals of smiling weather,
succeeded by frowning clouds and petulant showers. Sudden storms,
accompanied by floods of tears, which dry rapidly as warmer feeling
prevails. The first Spring Hats begin to come out and the mewing of Pussy
Willow is heard in the land. The month will end with soft, engaging
weather.

MAY


[Illustration: _Gemini_]

The Twins

[Illustration]

THE TWINS

    Winter the Dotard, fool’d by April’s tears,
      Is fain to linger in the lap of Spring,
    When, with her tall twin brothers, May appears,
      And bids him have no thought of such a thing.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

CUPID’S FORECAST

MAY

Small birds will begin house-hunting and set the fashion by choosing
mates. Soft airs prevail and the skies are rosy. The first leaflets of
Spring poetry begin to come out. Occasional warm showers, melting hearts
and budding friendships. A few sharp storms, followed by bright making-up
weather.

JUNE


[Illustration: _Cancer_]

The Crab

[Illustration]

THE CRAB

    Since it is written “Crabbed Age and Youth
      Cannot together live,” now strange to tell,
    The crusty Crab for love of June’s sweet tooth
      Lays down his life and doffs his armored shell.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

CUPID’S FORECAST

JUNE

Depression in heart areas, relieved by brief storms which clear the air.
A wave of tenderness over all the heart regions, followed by a general
warm feeling and the glad ringing of church bells. If you are going
to cultivate Matrimony this year, now is the time to begin. Flowery
sentiments abound. Increasing warmth produces an atmosphere charged with
restlessness in the thickly peopled heart centres. Unsettled weather and
clouds, melting away in epistolary showers.

[Illustration]

THE LION

    See how the Lion rages in July
      And shakes his mane and walketh up and down,
    And roars for hunger. Shall I tell you why?
      The folk who feed him all are out of town.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

CUPID’S FORECAST

JULY

General seaward movement in the air, followed by ocean breezes and
heavily charged Hotel Atmosphere. Waves of hot air, principally on the
beaches and hotel piazzas. Engaging weather everywhere, with intervals
of changeableness. Cooler airs and tempermentary depression, which are
followed by clearing skies and renewed warm pressure.

[Illustration: _Virgo_]

The Virgin

[Illustration]

THE VIRGIN

    Come maidens all, for grace or beauty known,
      Behold your queen in virgin majesty—
    The Summer Girl, who sits on August’s throne
      And holds her court beside the laughing sea.

[Illustration]

[Illustration: _The Sands Of Time_]

CUPID’S FORECAST

AUGUST

Cupid’s Shooting Season is at its height. Steady weather. Bright skies
and continued prevalence of Hot Air. A few storms, violent, but of short
duration, and ending in still warmer conditions. Towards the end of the
month a slightly depressed atmosphere, but the month will end with a
sunlit sea and warm waves. The barometer will register very warm, close
weather, and many hearts hitherto unaffected will melt. Look out for
Moonstroke and Heartburn.

The Scales

[Illustration]

THE SCALES

    Careful September doth exactly weigh,
      Upon her balance, equal Night and Day;
    But when I make my reckoning in the Fall
      I find there is no “balance” there at all.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

CUPID’S FORECAST

SEPTEMBER

Somewhat cooler feeling, and petulent storms more prevalent. Engaging
weather becomes unsettled and breaks up. General moistness, followed
by downpours, clearing up in some quarters, but generally cloudy and
depressed, and the landscape will wear a gloomy and lonely appearance.

[Illustration: _Scorpio_]

The Scorpion

[Illustration]

THE SCORPION

    ’Tis said the Scorpion, when hemmed in by Fire,
      Mocking the flames, will do herself to death.
    So Summer dying smiles upon her pyre
      Of maples fanned to flame by Autumn’s breath.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

CUPID’S FORECAST

OCTOBER

Slight return of warmer conditions but varying and unreliable. End of the
month chilly. The first frost. The leaves of the Time Table begin to turn
rapidly. This may be taken as a sign of a change and is followed by a
return to a dense, high pressure atmosphere.

NOVEMBER


[Illustration: Sagittarius]

The Archer

[Illustration]

THE ARCHER

    I hear the singing of his cyprus bow
      As comes the Archer down the lonely ways,
    Through my sad heart his mournful arrows go,
      Winged with the memories of Summer days.

[Illustration]

[Illustration: _Gone!_]

CUPID’S FORECAST

NOVEMBER

Dull feeling in the air. Unpleasant underfoot for Hearts. Dark, cloudy
outlook, with small hope of clearing up. Heavy rain of bills, followed by
many terrible male storms. Weather brightens slightly, but stuffy towards
Thanksgiving. High winds follow, caused by everyone complaining at once
about the weather.

The Goat

[Illustration]

THE GOAT

    Frolic of foot yet bearded like a sage,
      The Goat may stand for Jovial Old Age.
    His horns are horns of plenty and good cheer,
      He is the jolly MASCOT of the year.

CUPID’S FORECAST

DECEMBER

Brighter. Very cold for those outside, but warm on the inside, where
there is a tendency to Hot Air. The cheerful sounds of Kissing Larks are
heard under the mistletoe branches. Bracing weather everywhere. Excellent
for skates, and good slaying for Cupid. About the 25th of the month a
terrific shower of gifts and good wishes may be looked for. The month
will end in violent Brain Storms.

NOTE

For many years the question has been much discussed as to the value, to
Hearticulturists, of Moonlight as a plant food.

From our own experiments we have found it of the greatest help and a
decided stimulant to the Engagement Vines; the Proposal Plant invariably,
although seemingly on the point of bursting into flower, defers its
blossoming until a moonlight night; while our Hammock Vines have lost
half their sweetness when Moonlight has not been supplied them. On the
other hand, our Porch Climbers have not done so well with Moonlight.


TIDES

Their are two kinds of Tides, the Tied and the Untied. Most of the Tied
would rather be Untied and all of the Untied want to be Tied—and they
will. (This is life.)

All through the Spring months the Untied will be very active, in fact,
until the full of the late June Moon, known as the “Honeymoon,” after
which time a tremendous increase may be noticed in the Tieds. This is
often spoken of as “the Swell of the Tied.”

Through the summer months the Tieds will run smoothly (often because they
are far apart).

With Fall, however, many Tieds will be again united and it will be cold
and squally and there will be very large bill owes and storms.

But through it all the dear old Gulp Stream will ever flow merrily on,
dispensing Warmth, Good Cheer and Forgetfulness.

Some famous Tiedal waves have been:

    Brigham Young
    Venus
    Blue Beard
    Solomon

works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
