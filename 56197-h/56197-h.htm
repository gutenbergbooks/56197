<h2>AUTHORS’ NOTE</h2>

<p class="dropcap">In bringing out this, the second volume
of the Cupid’s Almanack, we have
deemed it advisable to devote our principal
effort to informing you, Good Hearticulturists,
just what the conditions of the
elements will be at the various seasons.
This is of the greatest importance, and the
success of your work depends largely upon
the judgment used in selecting the time
to begin.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm is necessary but do not be
too impetuous for many a failure has come
from rushing ahead while yet conditions
are too cold and many a Hope Vine has
been killed by a late frost.</p>

<p>If you have started your work indoors
do not be in too great haste to set out;
young plants need a great deal of warmth
and attention and can stand extremely high
temperature, while very little cold is apt to
be fatal.</p>

<p>In Hearticulture so much depends on—whether?</p>

<h3>CUPID’S FORECAST<br />
JANUARY</h3>

<p class="dropcap">General depression, caused by Brain-storms
of December. This is succeeded
by a wave of Good Resolutions, accompanied
by a general downpour of Ice Water.
The cold wave may be counted upon to
pass quickly, being followed by brighter
days and a Rising Glass.</p>

FEBRUARY</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Generally frigid airs, varied by storms
and melting spells, with changing temperature
until the Fourteenth, when a soft
wave will sweep over the country accompanied
by sentimental Mail Storms, resulting
in a general rise of temperament and
a happier atmosphere. Husbandmen who
are cultivating matrimony will be much
troubled through this month by the squally
nights.</p>

<h3>CUPID’S FORECAST<br />
MARCH</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Marked coldness, followed by windy
sighs, culminating in stormy bluster.
Alternate Frostiness and Melting. A depressing
month and one to test the intensity
of the heart gardener. All but the hardiest
plants must be given extreme attention, and
many gardeners, to avoid the danger of a
frost, sit up far into the night with their
favorite plants during this month. But at
the best it is apt to be chilly and unpleasant
going. The month ends in calm, indifferent
weather.</p>

<h3>CUPID’S FORECAST<br />
APRIL</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Less cold but very changeable. Brief intervals
of smiling weather, succeeded
by frowning clouds and petulant showers.
Sudden storms, accompanied by floods of
tears, which dry rapidly as warmer feeling
prevails. The first Spring Hats begin to
come out and the mewing of Pussy Willow
is heard in the land. The month will end
with soft, engaging weather.</p>

A few sharp storms, followed by bright
making-up weather.</p>

JUNE</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Depression in heart areas, relieved

A wave of tenderness over all the heart
regions, followed by a general warm feeling
and the glad ringing of church bells. If you
are going to cultivate Matrimony this year,
now is the time to begin. Flowery sentiments
abound. Increasing warmth produces
an atmosphere charged with restlessness in
the thickly peopled heart centres. Unsettled
weather and clouds, melting away in
epistolary showers.</p>

AUGUST</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Cupid’s Shooting Season is at its
height. Steady weather. Bright skies
and continued prevalence of Hot Air. A
few storms, violent, but of short duration,
and ending in still warmer conditions. Towards
the end of the month a slightly depressed
atmosphere, but the month will end
with a sunlit sea and warm waves. The
barometer will register very warm, close
weather, and many hearts hitherto unaffected
will melt. Look out for Moonstroke
and Heartburn.</p>

but warm on the inside, where
there is a tendency to Hot Air. The cheerful
sounds of Kissing Larks are heard under
the mistletoe branches. Bracing weather
everywhere. Excellent for skates, and good
slaying for Cupid. About the 25th of the
month a terrific shower of gifts and good
wishes may be looked for. The month will
end in violent Brain Storms.</p>

<h3>NOTE</h3>

<p class="dropcap">For many years the question has been
much discussed as to the value, to
Hearticulturists, of Moonlight as a plant
food.</p>

<p>From our own experiments we have
found it of the greatest help and a decided
stimulant to the Engagement Vines; the
Proposal Plant invariably, although seemingly
on the point of bursting into flower,
defers its blossoming until a moonlight
night; while our Hammock Vines have lost
half their sweetness when Moonlight has
not been supplied them. On the other hand,
our Porch Climbers have not done so well
with Moonlight.</p>

<h3>TIDES</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Their are two kinds of Tides, the Tied
and the Untied. Most of the Tied would
rather be Untied and all of the Untied want to
be Tied—and they will. (This is life.)</p>

<p>All through the Spring months the Untied
will be very active, in fact, until the full of the
late June Moon, known as the “Honeymoon,”
after which time a tremendous increase may be
noticed in the Tieds. This is often spoken of as
“the Swell of the Tied.”</p>

<p>Through the summer months the Tieds will
run smoothly (often because they are far apart).</p>

<p>With Fall, however, many Tieds will be
again united and it will be cold and squally and
there will be very large bill owes and storms.</p>

<p>But through it all the dear old Gulp Stream
will ever flow merrily on, dispensing Warmth,
Good Cheer and Forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Some famous Tiedal waves have been:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brigham Young</li>
<li>Venus</li>
<li>Blue Beard</li>
<li>Solomon</li>
</ul>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
